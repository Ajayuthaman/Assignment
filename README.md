# 🎮 Unity Assignment 🃏

Welcome to the **Unity Assignment**, a fun and interactive card-matching memory game built with Unity 2021 LTS. Test your memory by matching pairs of cards, track your attempts, and progress through different levels! But be careful, you have a **limited number of attempts** to finish each level—run out of attempts, and it's game over!

## 📝 About the Game

**Unity Assignment** is a memory-based card-matching game where the player flips cards and tries to find pairs with matching images. The game tracks the total number of attempts allowed, and if the player runs out of attempts before matching all pairs, the game is lost.
